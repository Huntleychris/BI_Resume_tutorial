# BI_Resume_tutorial

This is a tutorial that will take you from SQL Server Relational importaing data and using stored procedures to create the objects
to SQL Server Analysis Services using Visual Studio to build a basic cube
to PowerBI to flatten the cube into a tabular model
then to SSRS for embedded PowerBI 
and lastly into a web page using the embedded code.

I can't wait to see what people do with it.  This isn't a finished product it's a suggested starting point.  

Do it your way and share it with me.
